B9Lab Remittance Project

1. Any sender can send money to any recipient. 
2. Sender generates password and sends to recipient (out of process). Recipient password is checked to make sure it hasn't been used before.
3. Recipient can go to any registered exchange shop to get his/her funds
4. Exchange shop must be registered (Western Union only allows franchisees to operate) and have a password assigned by contract owner. Exchange shop must also provide a new password when withdrawing funds. Exchange Shop password is checked to make sure it hasn't been used before.
5. Killable functionality improved
