B9Lab Remittance Project

1. Any sender can send money to any recipient. 
2. Sender generates password and sends to recipient (out of process). Recipient password is checked to make sure it hasn't been used before.
3. Recipient can go to any registered exchange shop to get his/her funds
4. Exchange shop must be registered (Western Union only allows franchisees to operate). Exchange shop proprietor asks
recipient to provide his/her password in order to withdraw funds. Exchange shop proprietor gives recipient cash (out of  process)
5. Killable functionality now requires that contract be paused before it can be killed.
