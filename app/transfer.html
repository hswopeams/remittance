    <h1>Sender's Page</h1>
    <h3>
            A sender can use this page to initiate a transfer of money to any recipient. The sender generates a one-time password and provides it to the receipient.
            The transfer is completed when the recipient goes to a registered Exchange Shop
            and provides his or her password. The exchange shop proprietor withdraws funds for a specific transfer. The recipient must provide his/her password in order for this to work.
            <br/>
            The exchange shop proprietor giving the recipent local currency is assumed to take place out of the scope of this DApp.
            <br/>
            The initiator of the transfer can also cancel it after it has expired by only providing the receipient password.
